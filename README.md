## 🧑‍💻 Project Overview – DeepSeek Code Companion (AI-Powered Coding Assistant)

**DeepSeek Code Companion** is an AI-powered coding assistant built with **Streamlit** and powered by the **DeepSeek Coder LLM**. It provides intelligent code suggestions, explanations, and debugging assistance for developers across multiple programming languages — all from an intuitive, real-time chat interface.

This project demonstrates the power of integrating **large language models (LLMs)** into practical developer tools. It enhances productivity by offering code completion, refactoring tips, and natural language-to-code generation directly in the browser.
